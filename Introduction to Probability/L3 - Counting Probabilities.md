## A. Order in counting
- need to be more clever in the methods that we use for counting the likelihoods of events, which is related to combinatorics
	- keyword "sequences" $\to$ the order of counting matters!
	- each individual event is **independent**, then we have $2^n$ possibilities

>[!example] Example 1
>Compute the number of **unique sequences** of $10$ coin flips. Can utilize the formula: $P(A) = \frac{\text{\# ways that A can happen}}{\text{total \# things that can happen}}$
>
>Answer: $2^{10} = 1024$

## B. No replacement
- it is not possible to obtain the individual event again, as it has been removed.
>[!example] Example 2
>If we have a deck of $52$ cards. How many unique $5$ card runs can we deal off the top of the deck, without replacement? 
## C. The factorial
